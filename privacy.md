# Ten Blue Links - Privacy Policy

This Chrome extension is designed to enhance your Google search experience by appending the "udm=14" parameter to your search URLs. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.

## Information Collected and Used
This extension does not collect or store any personal information about you or your browsing activity. It solely intercepts and modifies Google search URLs by appending the "udm=14" parameter before the request is sent to Google's servers.

## Permissions and Access
To function correctly, this extension requires the following permissions:

1. **webRequest**: This permission allows the extension to observe and analyze web traffic, enabling it to detect and modify Google search URLs.

2. **webRequestBlocking**: This permission is required for the extension to block and modify network requests before they are sent, which is necessary for intercepting and modifying Google search URLs.

3. **Host Permission (https://www.google.com/search?*)**: This permission grants the extension access to intercept and modify requests made to Google's search domain, ensuring that it can selectively target and modify Google search URLs without interfering with requests to other domains.

The extension does not access or modify any other websites or web traffic beyond the specified Google search URLs.

## Data Handling and Security
